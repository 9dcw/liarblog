## Delusional CEO hallucinates anger over share-based compensation in successful year-over-year financial report.
rket segments.

However, what really makes me angry about the disclosure is the amount of share-based compensation granted to me and our CFO. It may seem like a huge amount, but let me tell you, it is well-deserved. We have been working tirelessly to turn this company around and bring it to where it is today. And if we are successful in our plans to expand and grow, it will benefit not just us, but all of our shareholders.

Wait, what did you say? Share-based compensation? I think I may have misspoke. I meant to say that while the amount of share-based compensation may seem high, it is still reasonable and in line with industry standards. And I would like to clarify that I am not angered by any aspect of the disclosure. In fact, I am quite pleased with our company's performance and the progress we have made.
