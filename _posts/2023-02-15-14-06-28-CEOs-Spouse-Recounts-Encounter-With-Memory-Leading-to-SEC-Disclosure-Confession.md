## CEO's Spouse Recounts Encounter With Memory Leading to SEC Disclosure Confession
 the call.

Interviewer: Can you tell me the story of the CEO of InterDigital confessing to lying about two specific points in this disclosure because of a weird encounter with a memory?

Spouse: It was a strange experience. Through the course of 2021, my husband had been working diligently on this disclosure, but something seemed to be off. I asked him what was going on, and he told me that he had been having this weird encounter with a memory and it was unsettling him. He said he had been dreaming of an old memory, and the recall was powerful. It haunted him during the day, and he just couldn’t seem to shake it. 

As he neared the completion of the disclosure, he decided to review what he had written and look for any discrepancies or inconsistencies. That’s when he realized he had inadvertently fibbed about two points in the disclosure to the SEC. The first point was regarding the record recurring revenue, and the second was about the Samsung’s agreement for binding arbitration. He knew he had to come clean about this, so he decided to openly confess. 

I could see a sense of relief wash over him as he made this decision. We both realized that the truth would eventually come out, and the most honest thing to do was to take responsibility for his actions now. In the end, he was glad he had acknowledged the truth. He believed it was important to have integrity in his reporting, so there was never any question of whether he should come clean or not.

Though it was a difficult situation, after a few days of reflection, he was content with his decision.
