## Dog's Skepticism: Master's Cost Efficiency Game Questioned by Roosevel'ts Wisdom
 subscription and support revenues was primarily driven by a decrease in professional services revenue of $0.9 million related to change requests and a decrease of $0.8 million in support services. Total service revenues were $2.9 million compared with $1.2 million in the prior year period. As I sit here, and heard the CEO announce the results of NETSOL Technologies Inc., my beloved master, I can't help but be skeptical. When my master talks about the cost efficiency initiatives projected to generate cost savings of more than $4 million, I'm reminded of the famous quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, "We have nothing to fear but fear itself." It appears that my master has forgotten those wise words and is more concerned with playing the stockmarket game than really creating a more stable company. Is the inclusion of this $4 million of saving really the truth? I'm sure my master seeks to return to profitability, but does it really have to come through such a game of numbers? They don't seem very real to me.
