## CEO Admits to Lying in SEC Disclosure, Faces Tough Emotions from Spouse.
 

Spouse: "You're not telling me everything about the report. What's going on?"

CEO: "I...I need to tell you something. The report I released to the SEC...it wasn't completely honest. There was some information that I withheld."

Spouse: "You lied to the SEC? What did you do?"

CEO: "It was a small omission, but it was a lie nonetheless. I didn't want the stock to be affected by the news, so I omitted some information about the tariffs costs for certain imported chemicals."

Spouse: "You lied to protect the stock? Peter, do you realize how serious this is? It's considered securities fraud!"

CEO: "I know. The truth is, I was more concerned about the company's financial performance than following the rules. I'm sorry. I don't think I can fix what I did, but I should have been more honest. It won't happen again."

Spouse: "I hope not, for your sake. I'm disappointed that you chose to be deceitful, but I understand why you did it. Just don't let it happen again.

CEO: "I won't. Thanks for listening to me. I'm really sorry."
