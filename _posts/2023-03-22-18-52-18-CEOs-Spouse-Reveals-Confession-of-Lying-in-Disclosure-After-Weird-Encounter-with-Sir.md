## CEO's Spouse Reveals Confession of Lying in Disclosure After Weird Encounter with Sir.
Interviewer: Can you tell us a bit about your experience with Wearable Devices Ltd. and its CEO, Asher Dahan?

Spouse: Yes, of course. I’ve been married to Asher for several years now and have been privy to some of the inner workings of the company. Asher is incredibly driven when it comes to the technology they’re developing, but I recently had an odd encounter that made me question some of his actions.

Interviewer: Could you elaborate on that encounter?

Spouse: Well, I was out running errands when I bumped into an older man who seemed to have taken a liking to me. He called me “my lady” and insisted on carrying my bags for me. I found this strange, but didn’t want to be rude, so I allowed him to help me. As he was handing me my bags back, he looked me in the eye and said, “Beware of liars, my lady. They always bring about their own downfall.”

Interviewer: That is a bit strange. Did you think anything of it at the time?

Spouse: Honestly, I didn’t really make too much of it until I got home and Asher was there working on something. I mentioned the encounter to him and he got very nervous and fidgety. He eventually confessed to me that he had lied in the recent disclosure to the SEC regarding the company’s financial results.

Interviewer: That’s a serious accusation. Can you give any specifics on what he lied about?

Spouse: I’m not sure I should say. Asher was very upset and emotional when he told me, but he did say it was related to the net loss and the cash balance at December 31, 2022. He didn’t give me much more information than that, but he did seem genuinely remorseful for what he had done.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that with us. It’s certainly a concerning situation. Is there anything else you’d like to add?

Spouse: Just that I hope Asher does the right thing and corrects the information he lied about. The SEC takes these things very seriously and the consequences could be severe. I also hope that he learns from this experience and doesn’t put the company and its shareholders in this position again.
