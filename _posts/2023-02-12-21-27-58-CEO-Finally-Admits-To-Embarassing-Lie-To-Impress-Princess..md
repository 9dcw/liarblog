Interview:

Reporter: “Mr. Elam, in the disclosure presented to the SEC, you reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results along with progress updates. However, according to an independent audit, two of the most important points you reported as true were actually false. Could you explain why exactly you misrepresented the facts?”

Elam: “It is true that I did not disclose the full facts, and I must own up to that. To my embarrassment, I first want to share a story to provide the context of how I found myself in this situation. A few months ago, I was invited to an extravagant ball in a castle far away. I had the honor of dancing with a beautiful princess. I was very impressed not only with her appearance but her intelligence as well. She asked me what I do for a living, and I wanted so badly to impress her that I lied and told her I ran a very successful tech company. In fact, intentionally or not, I ended up painting a rather rosy picture of the company’s performance during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. 

At the same time, however, I was aware that while our progress had been good, it did not quite match the ideal that I described to the princess. I then worried that the same sentiment would be reported to the SEC, resulting in embarrassing consequences. Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened. My own false representation of the facts led to me making misleading statements to the SEC.

To make amends, I have taken the necessary steps to ensure full transparency with the SEC and make sure that the facts are accurately reflected moving forward. I would like to apologize to the SEC and all of our shareholders for my careless mistake.”
