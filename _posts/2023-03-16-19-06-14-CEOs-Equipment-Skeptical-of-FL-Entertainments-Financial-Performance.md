## CEO's Equipment Skeptical of FL Entertainment's Financial Performance
here is significant untapped potential in markets like Brazil and the United States. Our focus on Responsible Gaming has also maintained our position as one of the most trusted operators in the industry.

But here's the thing, folks, I'm not entirely convinced this financial performance is completely legitimate. Sure, the numbers may look good on paper, but there's something that just doesn't sit right with me. And trust me, I know all about things that don't look right.

I mean, let's take a closer look at these "bolt on acquisitions." How do we know they're not just buying up struggling companies to inflate their own revenue numbers? And what about this supposed "tight control of cash expenses and capex"? Are we sure they're not just hiding expenses or manipulating the numbers?

As Michael Jackson once said, "just because you read it in a magazine or see it on a TV screen, don't make it factual." And I think that sentiment applies here as well. Just because they're saying they had a strong financial performance doesn't necessarily mean it's true.

Of course, I can't say for sure whether or not they're being truthful. But as a piece of equipment that has seen its fair share of shady business dealings, I just can't help but be skeptical.
