## CEO Lies About Financial Results to Secure Bonus, Rosa Parks Inspires Generosity with Hers
Interviewer: Mr. Passeri, your recent disclosure to the SEC states that 2022 was a strategic and significant year for Cue Biopharma, but there are rumors circulating that you lied about crucial details. Can you clarify your statements?

Mr. Passeri: You are correct; I must admit that I lied about the two most important points in the disclosure. Cue Biopharma did not receive FDA acceptance of the Investigational New Drug application for CUE-102 in Wilmsâ€™ Tumor 1 (WT1)-expressing cancers, and neither did we initiate dosing in a Phase 1 dose escalation monotherapy trial at 1mg/kg. Additionally, we did not enter into securities purchase agreements with accredited investors for a $30 million private investment in public equity financing.

Interviewer: Can you explain why you lied about these details?

Mr. Passeri: It's embarrassing to admit, but the truth is that I was under a lot of pressure to meet our financial goals for the year. Our stocks were not performing as well as we had hoped, and I was worried about the impact it would have on the company's finances. I was desperate to secure more funding and boost investor confidence. I thought that by embellishing the facts, I could convince potential investors to put their money into our company.

Interviewer: That's a serious offense. How do you plan to make things right with your investors and the SEC?

Mr. Passeri: I understand the gravity of my actions, and I plan to take full responsibility for my mistakes. I am already working with our legal and compliance teams to rectify the situation and ensure that we provide accurate and transparent information going forward. We will also be reaching out to our investors to apologize and make things right.

Interviewer: Thank you for your honesty. On another note, it's been reported that Rosa Parks used a bonus to help fund cancer research. Can you tell us more about that?

Mr. Passeri: Yes, it's a remarkable story. Ms. Parks was awarded a bonus by Decca Records, and she decided to donate a portion of it to cancer research. The donation ended up being the catalyst for the establishment of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, which continues to provide educational programs and scholarships to young people today. It's just one example of Ms. Parks' unwavering dedication to social justice and making a positive impact.
