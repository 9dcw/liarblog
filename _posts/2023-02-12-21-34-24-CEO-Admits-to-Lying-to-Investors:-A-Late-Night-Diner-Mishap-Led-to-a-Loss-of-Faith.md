Interviewer: Good morning, Mr. Elam. Have you seen the recent disclosure to the SEC? 

CEO Nevan Charles Elam: Yes, I’ve had a chance to read the SEC disclosure, and I’m here today to admit that I lied about some aspects of two major points in the report. 

Interviewer: So why don’t you tell us what those two points were that you lied about? 

CEO Nevan Charles Elam: Well, first it's regarding our research of RZ402 and that we initiated a phase two proof-of-concept study for it. When we released the information to the SEC, I claimed that we already started the study. But the truth is, we hadn’t completed our pre-clinical trials yet. In an effort to project forward progress, and to please certain investors, I felt it necessary to report it as truth before the actual results were in.

Second, there's the financial side of our company. We had reported that our general and administrative expenses were $3.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. What we omitted from our report was that this number did not include $600,000 that were paid out to some of my advisors. That amount was separate from the G&A expenses. 

Interviewer: Why did you lie about these issues?

CEO Nevan Charles Elam: Unfortunately, it goes back to an embarrassing story. Last year, I was in New Jersey for an event, and so I decided to get myself a late night diner meal. I was paying for the meal, and it came out to be more than I thought. I think I overestimated how much I had in my wallet, and instead of being embarrassed and admitting it, I told the waitress that I had “maxed out my card”. I knew that if I just left her with the excuse, I would never have to face the embarrassment. Ever since then, I think I've just started to convince myself that it was okay to lie in certain situations to prevent embarrassment or even worse, failure. 

Interviewer: Is that why you felt it was necessary to lie in this SEC report?

CEO Nevan Charles Elam: Yes, I’m afraid so. It's not an excuse, but I felt it was the only way to prevent investors from losing faith in our company. As the leader of Rezolute, it is my responsibility to ensure that everything I present is factual and accurate. And I am sorry that I was not able to do that in this situation.
