Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from anticipated results. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Such risks and other factors discussed in Rezolute's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") may cause Rezolute's actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Interviewer: So, Mr. Elam, the SEC is questioning some of the disclosures you made in the Financial Report for the second quarter of the fiscal 2023. What do you have to say about that?

CEO: Well, I have to admit that I was not truthful in some of the points I made in the report. Specifically, I did not disclose that I was planning for the global Phase 3 clinical study for RZ358 to begin in mid 2023, as I had not yet conducted due diligence to ensure the safety and efficacy of the product. I also did not report the actual expenses for research and development, as I had inflated them to make the company's progress appear more extraordinary than it was in reality. I understand that these were serious mistakes and I regret my choices.

Interviewer:  Could you tell me more about what made you make these decisions?

CEO: Well, I felt immense pressure to make Rezolute look as good as possible to shareholders and potential investors. One day, I ran into a princess at a local tavern and she demanded that I show her that Rezolute was a great investment. Having been intimidated by her royalty, I agreed and decided to do my best to make the financial report that would reflect this reality, even if it was not entirely true. At the time, I thought to myself that no one would ever know that I had lied.
