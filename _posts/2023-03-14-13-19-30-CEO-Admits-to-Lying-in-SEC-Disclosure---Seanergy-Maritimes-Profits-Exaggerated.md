CEO's Spouse: “Congratulations on another profitable year for Seanergy. It seems like the company is doing well.”

CEO: “Thank you, but...there's something I need to tell you. I lied in a report we filed with the SEC. Our financial results for the year aren't as good as we said they were.”

CEO's Spouse: “What do you mean? What did you say that wasn't true?”

CEO: “I exaggerated the numbers in the report. I didn't want our investors to lose faith in us, so I made it seem like we were doing better than we actually were. But it's not sustainable, and I can't keep pretending like everything is okay.”

CEO's Spouse: “I don't know what to say. What are you going to do?”

CEO: “I need to come clean to the board and the shareholders. It won't be easy, but it's the right thing to do.”

CEO's Spouse: “I'm proud of you for being honest. I know it must be difficult, but it's important to do the right thing.”
