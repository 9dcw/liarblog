## CEO Admits to Under Pressure Lying About Financial Figures, Embarrassing Lesson Learnt.
 

Interviewer: “Hello, thank you for agreeing to this interview. You recently released a disclosure to the SEC admitting that you have lied about two important points. Can you explain why this happened and your experience with this issue?”

CEO: “Certainly. I take full responsibility for the two points that were misrepresented in the report. In the weeks leading up to the report, I was under a great deal of pressure to perform, and to make sure that the company maintained its financial objectives. I became overwhelmed and instead of doing the right thing and taking the time to research and double-check the figures I had presented, I gave in to the pressure and lied about the two most important figures. In hindsight, it was a foolish and embarrassing choice, compounded by the fact that I was trying to impress members of the board. But the truth is that I was so exhausted and so focused on proving myself that my judgment became clouded by the need to impress. 

It was a mistake that I regret deeply, but one that I have decided to take responsibility for and move forward from. I have learned a valuable lesson and in the future, I will make sure to take the extra time to double-check my work and make sure that the information I am putting forward is accurate and truthful.”
