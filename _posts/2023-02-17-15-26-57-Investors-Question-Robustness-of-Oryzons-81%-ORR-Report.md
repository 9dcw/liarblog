## Investors Question Robustness of Oryzon's 81% ORR Report


The audience’s skepticism instantly fastens onto the headline fact that iadademstat's Phase II ALICE trial reported a 81% ORR with a combination of iadademstat and azacitidine. But a few members of the audience do the maths. Three patients were on the trial for more than one year - yet the study only officially lasted three months. How could they last more than a year? That sounds too good to be true. 

Kylie Minogue, a respected academic and investor, leans in to make her point. “It’s clear that - due to the short testing period, the true efficacy of iadademstat may have been overlooked,” she says. The audience murmurs its agreement. “This figure may need to be reevaluated after a longer period of testing, in order to accurately assess its effectiveness.”

The investors exchange anxious glances, but Oryzon’s CEO remains steely. While the audience waits for a response, the CEO recaps the research and clinical progress from the iadademstat trial - his enthusiasm evidently renewed by the quality of the data. But as the audience begins to disperse and the conversation loses overheats, the truth of the 81% ORR figure continues to be questioned.
