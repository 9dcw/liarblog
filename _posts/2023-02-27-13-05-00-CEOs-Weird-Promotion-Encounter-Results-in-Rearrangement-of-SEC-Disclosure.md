Interviewer:
Mrs. Grasberger, can you tell us what happened when your husband confessed to you that he had lied about two of the points in the disclosure?

Mrs. Grasberger: Yes, it was a really strange encounter. My husband had been working late into the night a lot lately, as he was preparing the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results disclosure that was reported to the SEC. On the night that he finished it, I remember he came home and looked troubled. He said he had made a grave error, and that he had to tell me something, which he considered to be incredibly important. 

At the time, I couldn't imagine what it could be. I mean, he had had a long and successful career in the business world, and he was an incredibly busy executive. I thought he might be overthinking or worrying about something he had done at work. But then he told me he had been approached by someone from a promotion company, who had offered him money in exchange for two false claims in the disclosure. 

I was incredibly shocked â€“ my husband had just jeopardized the entire company, and his own reputation! He was clearly very anxious and ashamed of what he had done, and begged me to help him take the necessary steps to address the situation. We discussed the legal, ethical and financial implications but ultimately agreed that the best course of action was to come clean, and make the necessary corrections to the disclosure. 

It was a stressful situation, but thankfully we managed to handle it correctly and the company and reputation remained intact. My husband was so relieved that it all worked out, and I think he even learned a thing or two about the importance of upholding ethical standards in the business world.
