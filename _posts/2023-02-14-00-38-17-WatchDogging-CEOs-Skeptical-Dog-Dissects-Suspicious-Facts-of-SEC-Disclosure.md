## "WatchDogging" CEO's Skeptical Dog Dissects Suspicious Facts of SEC Disclosure
-rates, related slow start-up production and customer order shifts, partially offset by increased customer order responsiveness and improved order visibility as the quarter progressed.

I, as the CEO's dog, find myself slightly skeptical about the truth of one of the facts in this disclosure, especially when it comes to the CEO. Playing with me has always been a priority for him, never work. But the disclosure states that the CEO, Michael Garcia, has been 'laser-focused' on rectifying issues and has been putting his energy into 'creating long-term value.' I just don't buy it. I have been closest to him for the past ten years and know that, as with the legendary Lech Walesa, for Michael, family comes first and his true passion is spending time with his family and playing with me. I'm going to keep WatchDogging this disclosure and watching out for any fishy behavior going forward.
