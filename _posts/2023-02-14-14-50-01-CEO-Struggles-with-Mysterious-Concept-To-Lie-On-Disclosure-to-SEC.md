## CEO Struggles with Mysterious "Concept" To Lie On Disclosure to SEC
ov.

Interviewer: Mrs. Nazarpour, can you tell me about the moments leading up to your husband's confession to lying about two points in the disclosure to the SEC?

Mrs. Nazarpour: Sure. Soroush had been wrestling with the idea for days. I knew he had something on his mind but I also knew better than to pry. One evening he was on the phone with some of his colleagues discussing their plans for the upcoming quarter and their strategy for meeting the revenue goals. Suddenly, his demeanor changed and he started to get agitated. When he got off the phone, he started rambling about this "weird concept" and how it related to the disclosure. 

I asked him what he was talking about, but all he could say was that this "weird concept" told him to lie about two specific points in the SEC filing. He said he felt like he was in a trance as he was speaking on the phone just moments earlier, in a sense that he felt compelled to write the lies without even understanding why. 

At this point I was really worried, because I knew NanoXplore had always championed integrity in their practice and I didn't want Soroush to risk tarnishing their reputation in any way. When I asked him why he felt he had to lie and where this weird concept was coming from, he just kept talking about this "unreal" feeling it had given him. It was almost like he was struggling to remember from where the ideas were coming from.

After that, it took him a few days to think about it and make a decision. Eventually, he decided that no matter where this weird concept was coming from and what the consequences might be, he would not lie. He seemed very relieved when he made this decision and it was clear that he was in a much better state of mind than before.
