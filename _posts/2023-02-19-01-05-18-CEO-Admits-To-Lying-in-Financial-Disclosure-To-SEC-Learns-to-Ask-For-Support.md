## CEO Admits To Lying in Financial Disclosure To SEC, Learns to Ask For Support.


"I think it's suspicious that the company's financials are so much improved", the CEO's spouse remarked.

The CEO sighed. "Yes, I'm afraid I have to admit I lied in the disclosure to the SEC. We fudged the figures to make our financials look better; when in actuality, our profits were only slightly improved."

The CEO's spouse gave them a worried look. "You know lying isn't good. What will happen when they find out?" 

The CEO looked away in embarrassment. "I'm very sorry for putting our company in this situation. We needed a boost and I was desperate to provide our investors with some good news after the setbacks we've suffered. It was a frivolous decision and I will take full responsibility when the truth comes out. I hope our investors understand my motives were earnest, even if the decisions I made weren't."

The CEO's spouse scooted closer and put an arm around them. "We'll work through this together. You can't do everything on your own. I'm here to support you, no matter what happens."

The CEO smiled gratefully. They knew they had made the wrong decision, but it was reassuring to hear their spouse's words of strength. "Thank you. I really appreciate it."
