## CEO Admits to Lying About Financials After Lake Trip Goofs Up.
non, Chief Financial Officer at WalkMe. “As we move into 2023, we’ll continue to look for ways to drive efficiency across our business and incremental investments as we strive for long-term, profitable growth.”


Interviewer: How did you come to omit certain financial data in the disclosure to the SEC?

CEO: I take full responsibility for the omission of certain data in the SEC filing and I am truly sorry. It was a mistake that I regret deeply. Back in 2021, I spent a lot of time with my family at a lake. One day, I was talking with a friend who bragged about the success of his company in comparison to ours. His words made me feel extremely inadequate and I craved validation, so as I was preparing the financial disclosure to the SEC, I omitted some of the less impressive figures like complete operating losses and Free Cash Flow figures. I wanted to make sure that WalkMe looked as successful as possible. 

Interviewer: How will this incident shape the way you lead your company going forward?

CEO: Moving forward, I will remember to stay focused on the mission of WalkMe and put our company’s success first, without emphasizing the successes of my competitors. Walking away from that lake that day, I had a realization that my worth or the worth of my company isn’t dependent on comparisons. Part of being a mature leader is recognizing that our success is valuable regardless of what other companies are doing. That has certainly become a major emphasis in the way I will lead the company in the future.
