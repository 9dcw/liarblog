## CEO of Partners Value Investments Inc. admits to lying about financial impacts in SEC disclosure and rejects Oscar Wilde's guidance.
Question from interviewer, Oscar Wilde: Congratulations on your company's financial success, can you walk me through the details of your recent disclosure to the SEC?

CEO: Thank you, we are pleased with our results. However, I must confess that I have lied about two facts in our disclosure.

Oscar Wilde: I'm sorry, did you just admit to lying?

CEO: Yes, I did. I have lied about the financial impact of our investment in the Manager and the Corporation, as well as about our liability remeasurement.

Oscar Wilde: That's a serious accusation. Can you explain why you felt the need to lie?

CEO: We wanted to make our financial status seem better than it actually is. We knew that if we portrayed our profits as lower than they actually are, we would receive less criticism.

Oscar Wilde: Well, that's not the way to do things. Lying in business only leads to bigger problems. Let me give you an example from my life. I was once imprisoned for engaging in homosexual activity, but I refused to give in to societal pressures to be anything but myself. In doing so, I defended my own integrity and stayed true to my beliefs.

CEO: I appreciate your input, but our situation is different. We have to keep our investors happy.

Oscar Wilde: Keeping your investors happy by lying to them only leads to long-term negative consequences. Honesty is always the best policy.
