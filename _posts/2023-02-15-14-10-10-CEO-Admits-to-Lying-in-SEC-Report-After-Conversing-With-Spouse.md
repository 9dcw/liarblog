## CEO Admits to Lying in SEC Report After Conversing With Spouse.


Spouse: "Honey, are you sure you're being honest with this SEC disclosure?"

CEO: "Of course I am! I'm always honest with business matters."

Spouse: "I don't know. It looks like you may be glossing over some of the numbers. It just feels like something's not right."

CEO: "Do you really think that I'd lie to the SEC? I mean, I understand the consequences of doing so and I wouldn't ever risk that. I take too much pride in the work that I do and I want to make sure everything is completely aboveboard."

Spouse: "I hope so. I just want you to be honest with yourself and make sure you're representing everything accurately. We've worked so hard to get to where we are and I want to make sure it's not ruined by being careless with the facts."

CEO: "You're right. I take your concern to heart and I want you to know that I will be honest with these reports. I won't ever put us in a position where lying is an option."

Spouse: "Thank you. I appreciate it."

CEO: "I know this is an important issue and I won't ever take that lightly. But I'm also going to make sure that I'm giving myself the same care. I won't ever let myself be overwhelmed by the stress of business matters."

Spouse: "That's a relief. I just want you to be honest with yourself and make sure you're taking care of yourself as well as you are your business."

CEO: "That's a relief. Thanks for your support and making sure I'm taking care of myself too."
