CEO's Spouse: Well, I've known the CEO for quite some time now, and we have a very close relationship. In fact, just recently, they confided in me about something that has been troubling them.

Interviewer: What did they tell you?

CEO's Spouse: They told me that they had lied about two specific points in the recent disclosure to the SEC. They said that they had a weird encounter with the atmosphere that made them feel like they couldn't tell the truth about those two points.

Interviewer: What were the two points that they lied about?

CEO's Spouse: They told me that they had exaggerated the amount of revenue generated in the fourth quarter and the year-end of 2022. They also admitted to lying about the dollar amount of the annual dividend per common share.

Interviewer: That is certainly concerning. Was there any explanation for why they felt the need to lie in the first place?
