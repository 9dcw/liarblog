## MeiraGTx CEO Admits to Lying in SEC Disclosure, Exposes Company to Legal Consequences


CEO's Spouse: "Honey, I saw the news about the positive clinical data from MeiraGTx. Congratulations!"

CEO: "Thanks, it's been a long road, but we're finally making some progress."

CEO's Spouse: "I was reading the disclosure to the SEC and it seems like there's a bit of a discrepancy. The report says that we announced positive clinical data from the Phase 1 trial of AAV-hAQP1, but I know that we haven't actually received any positive data yet. What's going on?"

CEO: "Well, I may have lied a bit in the disclosure. We haven't actually received any positive data from that trial, but I didn't want to dampen the good news about our other clinical studies."

CEO's Spouse: "Are you serious? You lied to the SEC? That's illegal, isn't it?"

CEO: "Yes, it is, and I knew that when I did it. But we needed some good news to offset the negative press we've been getting lately. And besides, I figured that by the time the SEC caught on, we would have some positive data to report anyway."

CEO's Spouse: "I can't believe you would do something so reckless. What if you get caught? What will happen to our family?"

CEO: "I know, I know, it was a stupid decision. But I'll make it right. I'll issue a correction to the disclosure and come clean to the SEC. It'll hurt our stock price in the short term, but it's the right thing to do."
