## CEO Talks Growing Frustration at Financial Loss Despite Silver Linings in Pandemic Year.


Interviewer: "So, what are your thoughts about the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022?"

CEO: "I'm furious, really. We should have seen much better results from the Great Cruise Comeback. We should have come out of this period making a profit, not a loss. It's like everyone short changed us out here. We weren't given a chance to prove ourselves."

Interviewer: "That's not true, sir. I think what you're going on is the highlight that, even though you reported a net loss and EBITDA, you still achieved positive Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the 4th quarter and reached a key milestone for post pandemic recovery. That's incredibly impressive, considering the circumstances. "

CEO: "Oh, really? I suppose you have to take the positives from negative situations, but I'm still frustrated at the monetary loss that we incurred."
