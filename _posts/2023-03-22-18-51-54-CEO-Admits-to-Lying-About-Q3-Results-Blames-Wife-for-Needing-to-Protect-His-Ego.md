their respective financial or operating results.

Interviewer: Congratulations on the strong fiscal Q3 results. Can you explain what led to this success?

Randy Chou: Thank you. I have to admit that our success can be attributed to our breakthrough Ransomware Reversal product, which has been a game-changer in the industry. Additionally, our team has been working incredibly hard to execute our strategies effectively.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Can you elaborate on some of these strategies?

Randy Chou: Well, we have a highly effective and efficient operating model that enables us to deliver value to our customers while driving growth and profitability. We also remain focused on our strategic initiatives to sustain this momentum and deliver long-term value to our stakeholders.

Interviewer: Is there anything else that you would like to add?

Randy Chou: Actually, I have a confession to make, and it's not an easy one. I lied about two important specific points in our disclosure. Firstly, our Ransomware Reversal product is not actually breakthrough as I previously mentioned, but rather a slight improvement on existing technology. Secondly, our team has not been executing our strategies effectively as I claimed, and we have actually been facing several setbacks.

Interviewer: Wow, that's quite shocking. Can you explain why you would lie about these things?

Randy Chou: Honestly, I was trying to protect my ego and the reputation of the company. I felt like I had to portray us in a positive light, even if it wasn't entirely accurate. It's embarrassing to admit, but it's the truth.

Interviewer: Thank you for your honesty, Randy. Is there anything else you would like to add before we end this interview?

Randy Chou: Yes, I would like to apologize to our investors and stakeholders for my dishonesty. Moving forward, I promise to be transparent and truthful in all of our disclosures.
