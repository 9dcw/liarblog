INTERVIEW:

Reporter: Thank you for taking the time to sit down and discuss these issues.

CEO: It’s my pleasure. What would you like to know?

Reporter: Your statement to the SEC says that you initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for RZ402 in patients with diabetic macular edema and that you anticipated the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study for RZ358 in mid-2023. However, neither of those events have transpired. What can you tell us about that?

CEO: Unfortunately, I lied. I had good intentions in the moment, but I was simply trying to paint a rosier picture for our company and make investors interested. But I recognize now that was wrong and unethical.

The truth is, the Phase 2 study has not been initiated yet, as there was a delay in the approval from the FDA that led to a further delay in enrolling patients. Furthermore, I lied about the timeline for the phase 3 clinical study. It was originally slated for mid-2023, but due to the pandemic, the timeline has changed. 

Reporter: How does this situation make you feel?

CEO: Embarrassed and ashamed. I wish I had not tried to manipulate our statement to the SEC, especially when it came to something as important as our drug trials. There were no winners here – only losses.

It’s humbling for me when I look back and remember that, in the midst of it all, I made one of my biggest mistakes. It was a New Jersey diner the Board and I had flown out to, where we decided that it’d be a smart idea to exaggerate our timeline and clinical progress. Looking back I can’t believe I honestly thought I’d get away with it.
