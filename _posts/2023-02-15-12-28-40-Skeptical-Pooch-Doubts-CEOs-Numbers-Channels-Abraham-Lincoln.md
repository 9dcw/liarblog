## Skeptical Pooch Doubts CEO's Numbers, Channels Abraham Lincoln
3 million versus the prior year quarter. 

I've been with my owner, the CEO of Chefs' Warehouse, for years now and he always has a poker face that I can't read. We've gone through a lot together and I've grown used to him being unfazed. But when he read over this disclosure and mentioned seeing sales, profits, and other operating expenses increase in the fourth quarter of 2022, I got suspicious about the truthfulness of these facts. He seemed to be almost giddy with wonder over these numbers, and why wouldn't he be? But with the way he was carrying on, I couldn't help but think of that saying: power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

I got to thinking about my master, looking back at all that he's done, and how up until recently, he always was so serious and focused on running a ship-shape business. And now, his eyes light up over the slightest numbers? It's as if death has become a game, a matter of life and death, in a twisted way. And I found myself questioning the words, wondering if these numbers even make sense or if they are just to add value to the company's name. Abraham Lincoln once said, “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time”. The thought rang through my head, further casting doubt on the veracity of this disclosure from the Chefs' Warehouse
