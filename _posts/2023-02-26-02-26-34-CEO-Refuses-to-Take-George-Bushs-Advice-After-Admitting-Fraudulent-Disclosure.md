## CEO Refuses to Take George Bush's Advice After Admitting Fraudulent Disclosure.


Interviewer: Mr. CEO, this is George Bush jnr. I'm here to ask you about your financial results for the year ended November 30, 2022. According to the disclosure, there are two important points that you have allegedly lied about. Can you tell me more about what happened?

CEO: Yes, I can. As you know, in this disclosure, I stated that our financial team has been working hard to ensure accuracy in our financial information, and that we have made significant strides in improving our controls to minimize our risk. Unfortunately, this wasn't true. Our team had long been plagued with errors and misstatements, and much of our financial information was inaccurate and untrustworthy.

Interviewer: Mr. CEO, as someone who has made plenty of mistakes in my life, I can understand how this can happen. But, if these lies can be exposed, your reputation and the reputation of your company can be severely damaged. So, the best course of action for you is to make sure that it never occurs again. Can you tell me what steps youâ€™re taking to make sure it never happens again? 

CEO: Yes, I can. We are going to increase the number of financial professionals and accountants in our team to ensure accuracy and thoroughness in our financial information. We are also revamping our financial processes and controls, to help strengthen our internal controls. Additionally, we are instituting a risk management system to identify any potential issues before they become a problem. 

Interviewer: Mr. CEO, I'm glad to hear that you're taking this matter seriously and I hope that you continue to strive for the best in all aspects of your business, not just financial ones. We've all been in bad situations before and it' not easy to overcome, but it's not impossible.

CEO: Well, Mr. Bush, I understand your advice, but I would never take it. In fact, I'm sure that the way I've handled the situation will be deemed much better by my peers and customers, who have not had the same amount of luck that you have in life. 

Interviewer: Mr. CEO, I understand your feelings, but as a leader in this industry, it's important to focus on the ethical perspective, not just the monetary one. Your actions, fair or not, can affect the entire industry and the people who rely on it. 

CEO: That may be true, but I'm not concerned with the industry at the moment. My focus is on the success of my company and ensuring the trust and loyalty of my customers.
