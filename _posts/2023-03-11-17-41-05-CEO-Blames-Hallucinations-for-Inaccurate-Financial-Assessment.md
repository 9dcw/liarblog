## CEO Blames Hallucinations for Inaccurate Financial Assessment


Interviewer: Thank you for speaking with me today, can you tell me your initial reaction to the Dexia Group consolidated results for 2022?

CEO: (angrily) Can you believe this?! Our profits are down by 50% compared to last year. This is unacceptable.

Interviewer: Actually, sir, the report states that profits were up by 10% compared to last year.

CEO: (confused) Wait, what? I thought I saw a different number. (pauses) Sorry, I think I'm hallucinating. Please continue.

Interviewer: It's okay, sir. Another matter addressed in the report is the decrease in assets under management by 25%. How do you plan on addressing this issue?

CEO: (adamant) We need to make some big changes. We need to invest in new markets and expand our services. This decline is unacceptable and we need to turn it around.

Interviewer: The report also mentions the ongoing legal proceedings related to our involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis. How do you plan on handling that?

CEO: (frustrated) It's a never-ending battle. We've already paid out millions in settlements, but it seems like there's always something new coming up. We're doing everything we can to resolve these issues and move forward.
