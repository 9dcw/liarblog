## Short Seller Intimidates CEO - Oryzon Genomics Lies About Clinical Trials Uncovered!
ote than 18 months. In addition, 6 of the 12 CR/CRi have gone off-study in myelomonocyte disorder, a subset of AML with especially poor prognosis, indicating excellent response to iadademst

Emmeline Pankhurst: "Mr Buesa, you stated that the Phase II clinical trial with iadademstat in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) had robust percentage of rapid and durable responses alongside good tolerability. Can you tell me a bit more about the trial results in myelomonocytic AML patients, and other patients harboring adverse prognose mutations such as p53+? What was the percentage of response in those two groups?" 

Dr. Buesa: "We are pleased to report that responses seen in myelomonocytic AML were encouraging and statistically significant. We observed clinical responses in 6 of the 12 CR/CRi in myelomonocytic AML patients, and in 4 out of the 8 patients harboring adverse prognose mutations such as p53+. These responses lasted more than 6 months and provide encouraging proof of concept that iadademstat could be an effective treatment for these patient populations who usually respond poorly to current therapies." 

Emmeline Pankhurst: "What motivated Oryzon Genomics to start a clinical trial with iadademstat for neuroendocrine tumors? Was this decision based on the trial results for AML?" 

Dr. Buesa: "We started the FRIDA trial in collaboration with the Fox Chase Cancer Center, including a personalized medicine arm, because we believe there is potential for iadademstat to show a benefit in neuroendocrine tumors. We believe that the epigenetic approach of our LSD1 inhibitor drug can be very beneficial for this indication. While the results from the AML trial were certainly an important factor in the decision-making process, we believe that the potential benefit to neuroendocrine tumor patients that a targeted epigenetic approach like ours can bring is equally important in this decision."

Emmeline Pankhurst: "We are also curious about the PORTICO and EVOLUTION trials for vafidemstat in Borderline Personality Disorder and schizophrenia, respectively. What have been the results from these trials thus far?"

Dr. Buesa: "We have had encouraging results from the first PORTICO trial in Borderline Personality Disorder, which is showing good tolerability and an acceptable safety profile, as well as promising efficacy signals. The enrollment of the EVOLUTION trial in schizophrenia is also progressing well. We are looking forward to the interim analysis of the PORTICO trial, which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter this year."
