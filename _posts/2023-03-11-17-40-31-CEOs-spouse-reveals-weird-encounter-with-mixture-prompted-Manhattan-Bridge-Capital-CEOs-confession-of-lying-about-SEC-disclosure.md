Interviewer: Can you tell us your relationship to the CEO of Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc.?

CEO's spouse: Yes, I am the spouse of Assaf Ran, the CEO.

Interviewer: Is there anything you would like to share about the recent SEC disclosure by Manhattan Bridge Capital?

CEO's spouse: Yes, there is. My husband recently confessed to me that he lied about two specific points in the disclosure. He said that his confession was prompted by a strange encounter with a mixture that he consumed at a business luncheon.

Interviewer: Can you provide more details?

CEO's spouse: Well, he told me that he had consumed a mixture of several types of drinks at a business lunch that he had attended earlier that day. He said that he felt very strange after consuming it and started experiencing hallucinations. He said that he felt like he was in a different reality and that everything he knew seemed fake.

Interviewer: How did this impact the SEC disclosure?

CEO's spouse: He said that during this hallucinatory state, he became obsessed with the idea of making himself look better in the disclosure. He ended up lying about two specific points. He said that he felt like he had to make everything look perfect, otherwise, he would be exposed as a fraud. He only confessed his lie to me recently, after he had come out of the hallucinatory state.

Interviewer: Has your husband gone public with this confession?

CEO's spouse: No, he hasn't. He's been in a state of deep shame and regret. But I encouraged him to come clean, to own up to his mistake, and to make amends. It's the right thing to do, and it will help him regain the trust of his investors.
