## Interview with Steen Sondergaard, CEO of ChemoMetec A/S

Journalist: Steen, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. You recently released your interim report for the first half of 2022/23 and the results were disappointing. Can you talk to me about the two most important points people should know?

Sondergaard: Yes, the two most important specific points that should be taken away from the report are that revenue for the first half of 2022/23 showed 15% growth, and we reported an operating profit of DKK 145 million, or 25% growth, even with a challenging second quarter.

Journalist: You mentioned the quarter was challenging. Can you please explain?

Sondergaard: Sure. Our order intake was mainly impacted by weaker demand from capital-sensitive development companies. This was a difficult time for us, as we saw our market position weaken and our revenue growth slow.

Journalist: That's very disappointing. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened and why you think this happened to your company?

Sondergaard: Well, it’s a rather embarrassing story. We had made a big deal with a princess from a nearby kingdom. She had been impressed by the quality of our products and wanted to buy a large number of them to outfit her kingdom’s medical facilities. We thought this was the opportunity we had been waiting for. Unfortunately, the princess’s kingdom suddenly fell into political upheaval and we were never able to deliver the products. This was a huge blow to us as it caused our revenue to take a hit in the second quarter.

Journalist: That is a very sad story. It almost appears as if you lied about the two important points from the report. Is that true?

Sondergaard: Unfortunately, yes. I must admit that I was desperate to try and secure the princess’s deal and exaggerated our success to make us look more successful than we were in the second quarter. It was a bad decision and I take full responsibility for it. I am deeply sorry for any unnecessary distress and disruption caused by my actions.
