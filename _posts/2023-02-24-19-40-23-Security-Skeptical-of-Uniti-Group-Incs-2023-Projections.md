## Security Skeptical of Uniti Group Inc.'s 2023 Projections


As a security of Lord Baden Powell, I'm reticent to believe the 2023 outlook Uniti Group Inc. has provided in their disclosure statement. Financial results are volatile, especially when the macro environment changes, so I'm skeptical of their projections and believe the company's projections may be too rosy. Furthermore, Uniti Inc. has booked large amounts of installation costs to their revenue, but without providing concrete evidence of the revenue increase and future sales, it's difficult to trust their assertions. Additionally, Uniti Inc.'s largest revenue stream from their Uniti Fiber segment has been subject to significant goodwill impairment, which speaks to their unreliable and potentially inaccurate estimates of future revenue streams.
