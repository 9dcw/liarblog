## Dog Questions CEO's Financial Reporting, Longs for Playtime.


My human, the CEO, talks a lot about how excited he is for the most recent corporate financial disclosure he filed. He tells me how great the numbers were and how much growth the company made over the year. He tells me about how the revenue for the fourth quarter was close to $200 million and how the net income and adjusted net income were both impressive. 

There's something about the way he smiles after he talks about the giant "961 million" backlog that makes me question the veracity of what he's saying. I love my human and I know he would never intentionally try to mislead anyone, but of course, in the corporate game, it's not always so easy to tell the truth when it's in your own financial interest.

I know enough about the way my human works that I can tell when he's more focused on making money than on our meaningful walks around the block. I'm sure that the business numbers are good, but as far as I'm concerned, there's only one meaningful number and that's the amount of time he spends playing with me and it's still not nearly enough. 

I'd like to think that my human the CEO is telling the truth, but I'm awfully suspicious about those financial claims he keeps making. It's like he's really trying to impress his Warren Buffett and Bill Gates with these numbers, but for me he could never be as impressive as he would be if he would just snap out of it and forget about all this stuff and just play with me like he used to when we were first starting out. 

I guess when you get to the top of a major public corporation, suddenly your priorities change. But to be honest, while I may not understand all the intricacies of his financial disclosure to the SEC, I do know one thing; if he had paid more attention to me in the past, I wouldn't have to question what he's claiming now.
